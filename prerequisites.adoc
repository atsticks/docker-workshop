== Prerequisites

=== Requirements

You will need a machine with at least `7GB RAM` and `8GB free disk space` available. Linux and MaxOS work best.
Windows works as well, where additional installation steps are required it should be mentioned in the workshop.


=== Software

==== Docker

You should have Docker installed. First check:

```shell
docker version
```

* If you don't have docker installed, check [here](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
  ** For *Windows*: follow instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/).
  ** For *Linux*: follow instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/).
  ** For *Mac OS* (Yosemite or newer), please download Docker for Mac [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg).
  ** Older docker package for *OSes older* than Yosemite -- Docker Toolbox located [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).*
* If you're not on the latest version, it will prompt you to update
* If you're not on docker group you might need to prefix commands with `sudo`. See [here](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access) for details about it.

NOTE: Under Windows the latest native container support requires Windows Professional or Server Licensing. Older
or other version of windows still require the legacy Docker Toolbox installation.

If all is working you are ready for the first part of the workshop...


==== Minishift

In the second part of workshop we will also use *minishift*. Ensure the following sotfware is installed:

- _Docker_
- _powershell_ if you are running on windows
- _openshift client tools_: https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html
- _minishift_: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html


==== Versions

Finally check your versions:

* *minishift version* -> v1.4.1
* *minishift openshift version* ->
  ** openshift v3.6.0+
  ** kubernetes v1.6.1
  ** etcd 3.2.1

If you have older version, thing may not work correctly, so we recommend to upgrade your installation.
