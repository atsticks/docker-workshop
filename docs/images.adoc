== Working with Images

So far we have been using container images downloaded from Docker's public registry. In this tutorial we will
uncover further features and see how we can build and manager our own images.

=== Searching for images

Docker allows you to search for images:

```
docker search -s 10 nginx
```

* **-s**: Only displays with at least x stars

=== Building a Container Image from scratch
==== Building our first container

The `Dockerfile` is a special file that instructs `docker build` command how to build an image.
So let's create the most simple Dockerfile:

```
echo "My first DockerImage says Hello $@!" > hello.sh
chmod ogu+x hello.sh
```

Then create a file named +Dockerfile+ with the following contents:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
```

Hereby

* `FROM scratch` instructs a Docker build process to use empty image to start building the container image.
* `ADD hello.sh /hello.sh` adds file `hello.sh` to the container's root path `/hello.sh`.

Then let's _build_ the Docker image:

```
$ docker container build -t hello .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 3.072 kB
Step 1 : FROM scratch
 --->
Step 2 : ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
 ---> 4dce466cf3de
Removing intermediate container dc8a5b93d5a8
Successfully built 4dce466cf3de
```


==== Viewing images

You can use `docker images ls` command to display images that we have built (or installed):

```
$ docker images ls
REPOSITORY                                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello                                         latest              4dce466cf3de        10 minutes ago      34 B
```

* Repository - a name of the local (on your computer) or remote repository. Our current repository is local and is
  called `hello`.
* Tag - indicates the version of our image, Docker sets `latest` tag automatically if not specified.
* Image ID - unique image ID.
* Size - the size of our image is just a few bytes.

NOTE: Docker images are very different from virtual image formats. Because Docker does not boot any operating system,
      but simply runs linux process in isolation, we don't need any kernel, drivers or libraries to ship with the
      image, so it could be as tiny as several bytes!


==== Running the image

So let's run our image. Surprisingly this gives as an error:

```bash
$ docker container run hello /hello.sh
write pipe: bad file descriptor
```

The problem is: our container is empty! There is no shell and the script won't be able to start.
So let's build our example using a small basic image, which contains a proper shell
environment. In our case we use `busybox`. To do so we have to adapt our `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
```

Similarly let's build the new image:

```bash
$ docker build -t hello .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 3.072 kB
Step 1 : FROM busybox
 ---> 00f017a8c2a6
Step 2 : ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
 ---> c8c3f1ea6ede
Removing intermediate container fa59f3921ff8
Successfully built c8c3f1ea6ede
```

Listing the image shows that image id and size has increased:

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello                                         latest              c8c3f1ea6ede        10 minutes ago      1.11 MB
```

We can run our example now:

```bash
$ docker run hello /hello.sh
My first DockerImage says Hello !
```

==== Versioning

Let us adapt the `hello.sh` file and roll a new version of our image called `v2`:

```bash
echo "My first DockerImage says AGAIN Hello $@!" > hello.sh
chmod ogu+x hello.sh
$ docker build -t hello:v2 .
```

We will now see 2 images: `hello:v2` and `hello:latest`

```bash
$ docker images ls
hello                                         v2                  195aa31a5e4d        2 seconds ago       1.11 MB
hello                                         latest              47060b048841        20 minutes ago      1.11 MB
```

NOTE: The Tag `latest` will not automatically point to the latest version: we will have to manually update it.

So execute the script using `image:tag` notation to define the exact version we want to run:

```bash
$ docker container run hello:v2 /hello.sh
My first DockerImage says AGAIN Hello!
```

=== Defining an Entry point

We can improve our image by supplying an `entrypoint`:

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/hello.sh"]
```

Then again, let's build a new container image:

```bash
$ docker container build -t hello:v3 .
```

The entrypoint remembers the command to be executed on start, even if you don't supply any arguments. So
we can start our image without passing any arguments:

```bash
$ docker container run hello:v3
My first DockerImage says AGAIN Hello !
```

=== Passing additional Parameters

We also can pass additional parameters. They will be forwarded into the container as arguments:

```bash
$ docker container run hello:v3 foo
My first DockerImage says AGAIN Hello foo!
```

This magic happens because our _hello.sh_ script prints passed arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "My first DockerImage says AGAIN Hello $@!"
```


==== Using the Container Environment

We can pass environment variables during build and during runtime as well. As an example we edit our +hello.sh+
shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "My DockerImage says Hello $MESSAGE!"
```

We can now define the MESSAGE as a fixed environment parameter.
Within the +Dockerfile+ we now use `ENV` directive to provide an environment variable:

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
ENV MESSAGE World
ENTRYPOINT ["/hello.sh"]
```

If we build the new version as follows:

```bash
$ docker container build -t hello:v4 .
$ docker container run -e MESSAGE=World hello:v4
My DockerImage says Hello World!
```


==== Build arguments

Sometimes it is helpful to supply arguments to the image build process
(for example, a user ID to create inside the container). We can supply build arguments
as flags to `docker build` as well:

So let's use the passed build argument to set the container environment in the +Dockerfile+:

```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
ADD hello.sh /hello.sh
ARG MESSAGE
ENV MESSAGE $MESSAGE
ENTRYPOINT ["/hello.sh"]
```

Then build and execute the container:

```bash
$ docker build --build-arg=MESSAGE="World and others" -t hello:v5 .
$ docker run hello:v5
My DockerImage says Hello World and others!
```


==== Build layers and Caching

Let's take a look at the image in the tutorials's cache directory:

```bash
$ ls -l ./cache/
total 12
-rw-rw-r-- 1 atsticks atsticks 76 Mar 24 16:23 Dockerfile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 atsticks atsticks  6 Mar 24 16:23 file
-rwxrwxr-x 1 atsticks atsticks 40 Mar 24 16:23 script.sh
```

Let's use the files to build yet another version of a 'hello' image:

```bash
$ cd ./cache
$ docker container build -t hello:v6 .

Sending build context to Docker daemon 4.096 kB
Step 1 : FROM busybox
 ---> 00f017a8c2a6
Step 2 : ADD file /file
 ---> 6f48df47cb1d
Step 3 : ADD script.sh /script.sh
 ---> b052fd11bcc6
Removing intermediate container c555e8ab29dc
Step 4 : ENTRYPOINT /script.sh
 ---> Running in 50f057fd89cb
 ---> db7c6f36cba1
Removing intermediate container 50f057fd89cb
Successfully built db7c6f36cba1

$ docker run hello:v6
hello, hello!
```

Now let's update the +script.sh+ by replacing it with +script2.sh+:

```bash
cp script2.sh script.sh
```

Now rebuild a new version of 'hello'. As expected the output is the same:

```bash
$ docker build -t hello:v7 .
$ docker run hello:v7
Hello, hello!
```

But mind the difference in the build output:

```
$ docker build -t hello:v7 .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  5.12 kB
Step 1 : FROM busybox
 ---> 00f017a8c2a6
Step 2 : ADD file /file
 ---> Using cache                              <1>
 ---> 6f48df47cb1d
Step 3 : ADD script.sh /script.sh
 ---> b187172076e2
Removing intermediate container 7afa2631d677
Step 4 : ENTRYPOINT /script.sh
 ---> Running in 51217447e66c
 ---> d0ec3cfed6f7
Removing intermediate container 51217447e66c
Successfully built d0ec3cfed6f7
```
<1> This part is read from the cache.

Docker executes every command in a special container. It detects the fact that the content has (or has not)
changed, and instead of re-exectuing the command, uses cached value instead. This helps to speed up builds, but
sometimes introduces problems.

NOTE: You can always turn caching off by using the `--no-cache=true` option for the `docker build` command.

*_Layers_*

Docker images are composed of layers:

image::image-layers.jpg[]

Every layer is a the result of the execution of a command in the Dockerfile. Basically every command in a
+Dockerfile+ adds a layer.


*_An example_*

The most frequently used command is `RUN`: it executes the command in a container,
captures the output and records it as an image layer.

Let's us use existing package managers to compose our images:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
ENTRYPOINT curl
```

The output of this build will look more like a real Linux install:

```bash
$ cd docker/ubuntu
$ docker build -t mycurl .
```

We can now use our newly created _mycurl_ to curl pages:

```bash
$ docker run mycurl https://google.com
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   220  100   220    0     0   1377      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1383
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
```

However, it all comes at a price:

```bash
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mycurl                                        latest              50928f386c70        51 seconds ago      221.8 MB
```

That is 220MB for curl! As we know, now there is no good reason to have images with all the OS inside. If you still
need it though, Docker will save you some space by re-using the base layer, so images with slightly different bases
would not repeat each other.


=== Operations with images

Executing `docker image` without parameters gives you
a summary of other image related commands:

```bash
$ docker image

Usage:  docker image COMMAND

Manage images

Options:
    --help   Print usage

Commands:
build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
history     Show the history of an image
import      Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image
inspect     Display detailed information on one or more images
load        Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN
ls          List images
prune       Remove unused images
pull        Pull an image or a repository from a registry
push        Push an image or a repository to a registry
rm          Remove one or more images
save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE

Run 'docker image COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```


==== Listing the locally installed images

You are already familiar with one command, `docker image ls` to get a listing of all currently installed images:

```shell
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

```


==== Inspecting images

You can inspect a cached image:

```shell
$ docker image inspect busybox

            ]
        }
    }
]

```

==== Removing images and containers

Let's start with removing the image that takes too much disk space:

```
$ docker rmi mycurl
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "mycurl" (must force) - container 292d1e8d5103 is using its referenced image 50928f386c70
```

Docker complains that there are containers using this image. How is this possible? We thought that all our containers
are gone. Actually, Docker keeps track of all containers, even those that have stopped:

```bash
$ docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS                           PORTS                    NAMES
292d1e8d5103        mycurl                       "curl https://google."    5 minutes ago       Exited (0) 5 minutes ago                                  cranky_lalande
f79c361a24f9        440a0da6d69e                 "/bin/sh -c curl"         5 minutes ago       Exited (2) 5 minutes ago                                  nauseous_sinoussi
01825fd28a50        440a0da6d69e                 "/bin/sh -c curl --he"    6 minutes ago       Exited (2) 5 minutes ago                                  high_davinci
95ffb2131c89        440a0da6d69e                 "/bin/sh -c curl http"    6 minutes ago       Exited (2) 6 minutes ago                                  lonely_sinoussi
```

So let's delete first the container...

```bash
$ docker container rm 292d1e8d5103
292d1e8d5103
```

...and then the image:

```bash
$ docker image rm mycurl
Untagged: mycurl:latest
Deleted: sha256:50928f386c704610fb16d3ca971904f3150f3702db962a4770958b8bedd9759b
```

==== Tagging images

`docker image tag` helps us to tag und untag images.

We have quite a lot of versions of `hello` built, but latest still points to the old `v1`.

```
$ docker image ls | grep hello
hello                                         v7                  d0ec3cfed6f7        33 minutes ago      1.11 MB
hello                                         v6                  db7c6f36cba1        42 minutes ago      1.11 MB
hello                                         v5                  1fbecb029c8e        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v4                  ddb5bc88ebf9        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v3                  eb07be15b16a        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v2                  195aa31a5e4d        3 hours ago         1.11 MB
hello                                         latest              47060b048841        3 hours ago         1.11 MB
```

Let's change that by re-tagging `latest` to `v7`:

```bash
$ docker image tag hello:v7 hello:latest
$ docker image ls | grep hello
hello                                         latest              d0ec3cfed6f7        38 minutes ago      1.11 MB
hello                                         v7                  d0ec3cfed6f7        38 minutes ago      1.11 MB
hello                                         v6                  db7c6f36cba1        47 minutes ago      1.11 MB
hello                                         v5                  1fbecb029c8e        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v4                  ddb5bc88ebf9        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v3                  eb07be15b16a        About an hour ago   1.11 MB
hello                                         v2                  195aa31a5e4d        3 hours ago         1.11 MB
```

Both `v7` and `latest` point to the same image ID `d0ec3cfed6f7`.


=== Publishing images

Images are distributed with a special service - `docker registry`.
Let us spin up a local registry:

```bash
$ docker container run -p 5000:5000 --name registry -d registry:2
```

`docker image push` is used to publish images to registries.

To instruct where we want to publish, we need to append registry address to repository name:

```
$ docker image tag hello:v7 127.0.0.1:5000/hello:v7
$ docker image push 127.0.0.1:5000/hello:v7
```

`docker image push` pushed the image to our registry running at _127.0.0.1:5000_.

We can now download the image using the `docker image pull` command:

```bash
$ docker image pull 127.0.0.1:5000/hello:v7
v7: Pulling from hello
Digest: sha256:c472a7ec8ab2b0db8d0839043b24dbda75ca6fa8816cfb6a58e7aaf3714a1423
Status: Image is up to date for 127.0.0.1:5000/hello:v7
```

=== Importing and Exporting of Images

`docker image save` exports a given image to a tar-archive:

```bash
$ docker image save busybox -o busybox.tar

$ ls -al busybox.tar
-rw-r--r-- 1 atsti 197609 1346560 Okt 19 11:00 busybox.tar
```

Similarly we can load a tar-ed image using `docker image load`:

```bash
$ docker image load busybox.tar busybox2:latest
sha256:03441f237f6dc635f18e9aa953b2ccc55b943b4b3247b01aadbf7855946cdbf3

$ docker image ls | grep busybox
busybox2            latest              03441f237f6d        10 seconds ago      1.34MB
busybox             latest              efe10ee6727f        3 months ago        1.13MB
```

Importing as file system image is done using `docker image import`:

```bash
$ docker image import busybox.tar busybox2:latest
sha256:03441f237f6dc635f18e9aa953b2ccc55b943b4b3247b01aadbf7855946cdbf3
```

The difference between these commands is +docker image save+ will indeed produce a tarball, but with all parent layers,
and all tags + versions. +docker export+ does also produces a tarball, but _without_ any layer/history.

Export is often used when one wants to "flatten" an image:

```bash
docker export <CONTAINER ID> | docker import - some-image-name:latest
```

However, once those tarballs are produced, load/import are there to:

* `docker image import` creates *one image* from one tarball which is not even an image (just a filesystem you want
  to import as an image).
* `docker image load` creates *potentially multiple images* from a tarred repository (since docker save can save
  multiple images in a tarball).


=== Pulling Images

You can also _pull_ images for installing them into the local cache:

```bash
$ docker image pull mariadb:latest
latest: Pulling from library/mariadb
85b1f47fba49: Pull complete
27dc53f13a11: Pull complete
095c8ae4182d: Pull complete

Digest: sha256:5f6f27abd461d2ed3dcbf61da39ecb87d47cbf341fad6e75f5b26246d9a44522
Status: Downloaded newer image for mariadb:latest

$ docker image ls | grep mariadb
mariadb             latest              18017b242307        9 days ago          397MB

```

=== Further image commands

You can get the history of an image:

```bash
$ docker image history busybox2
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY          SIZE                COMMENT
03441f237f6d        34 minutes ago                          1.34MB              Imported from -
```

You can prune unused images:

```bash
$ docker image prune
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY          SIZE                COMMENT
03441f237f6d        34 minutes ago                          1.34MB              Imported from -
```
