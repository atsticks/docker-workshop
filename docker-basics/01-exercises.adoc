## Exercises - Getting Started

### Exercise 1: Install Docker and the required tools

Yep, not really an exercise, but actually without this step being done, this workshop will only by half of the fun.
So let's ensure things are working on your machine.


### Exercise 2: RUN a NGINX Container and expose a Port

In this exercise you will start a web server running completely in a Docker container:

* get the `nginx` image
* Map the `nginx` port to port `4000` on your localhost
* Start the nginx server as a background daemon (detached mode)

NOTE: For more info about the `nginx` container, see https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/[here]


### Exercise 3: RUN a NGINX Container with a Volume


In this exercise we will mount a local directory as the `nginx` html server content root:

* start another nginx instance and map it to the local port 4001
* Mount your `${WORKSHOP_ROOT}/code/hello-world/site` directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the container FS
  (read-only)
