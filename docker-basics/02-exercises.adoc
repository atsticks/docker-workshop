## Exercises Part 2 - Working with Docker Images

### Exercise 1: BUILD a Git Client Container Interactively

* Use the ´alpine´ base image.
* You can install `git` with `apk --update add git`
* Call `git version` to verify your installation.
* Create a new image based on your modified container, name it `docker-git`.
* Launch (run) a container, which automatically removes itself, once it exits, and to execute `git version`.


### Exercise 2: BUILD a Git Client Container using a Dockerfile

* Create the same image as in the last exercise, using a `Dockerfile`.
* Launch (run) a container, which automatically removes itself, once it exits, and to execute `git version`.


### Exercise 3: BUILD an Apache Server Container Image with a Dockerfile

Create an Apache Server Container with `Dockerfile`:

* use the `alpine` base image.
* you can install the apache server with `apk --update add apache2 && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*`
* apache requires a directory `/run/apache2`
* apache exposes port 80
* the server can be started with `httpd -D FOREGROUND`


### Exercise 4: Push your webserver Image to a local Registry

* Start a local registry (call it `registry` ) and expose it's port `5000`.
* Then tag your webserver image under the registry namespace.
* Push your website to the local Registry.


### Exercise 5: PULL Your Image from your local Repository

* Delete your image from the local repository. Ensure it is not listed anymore using `docker image ls`.
* Pull your image now from the local registry.
