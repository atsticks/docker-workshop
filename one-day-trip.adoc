== Prerequisites

=== Requirements

You will need a machine with at least `7GB RAM` and `8GB free disk space` available. Linux and MaxOS work best.
Windows works as well, but may require additional installation steps.

=== Docker

Check you have latest version of docker installed:

```shell
docker version
```

* If you don't have docker installed, check [here](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
  ** For *Windows*: follow instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/).
  ** For *Linux*: follow instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/).
  ** For *Mac OS* (Yosemite or newer), please download Docker for Mac [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg).
  ** Older docker package for *OSes older* than Yosemite -- Docker Toolbox located [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).*
* If you're not on the latest version, it will prompt you to update
* If you're not on docker group you might need to prefix commands with `sudo`. See [here](http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access) for details about it.

NOTE: Under Windows the latest nnative container support requires Windows Professional or Server Licensing. Older
or other version of windows still require the legacy Docker Toolbox installation.
